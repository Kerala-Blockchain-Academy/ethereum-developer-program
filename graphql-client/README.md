# GraphQL Client

This is a minimal GraphQL client application for the EVM-capatable chains.

Currently, two queries are available:

- Latest Block
- Balance

## Prerequisites

**Note**: **A GraphQL-supported execution client is required**. Running [AetherGuild/Druid](https://github.com/Kerala-Blockchain-Academy/aetherguild) is an easier approach.

Update the endpoint URI in the [instance configuration](./src/main.tsx) according to your preference.

## Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the application:

```sh
npm run dev
```
